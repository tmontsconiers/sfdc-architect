# Integrations in General

## Systems need to talk to each other.

## No two integrations are the same.

## Middleware will be involved somewhere!

## There's a pattern for that!

Wikipedia defines a software pattern as follows:

```
"In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design."

```
<cite>Wikipedia contributors. "Software design pattern." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 16 Sep. 2018. Web. 8 Oct. 2018.</cite>

A pattern is:
* general
* reusable
* context-specific
    * platform
    * language

A pattern is not:
* a design
* an implemented solution
